AI to build enterprise software

Enterprise software has a reputation among smart programmers as being boring to work on. You have to do sales and because each potential customer wants something slightly different, you end up writing bloated software to try and please them all.

But what if AI could change how enterprise software gets built and sold? The core of what every customer wants is the same — they just want it customized around the edges.

AI is good at writing code — especially when you give it an existing codebase to learn from. So what if instead of long enterprise sales cycles you just give customers a simple starter product and have them tell your AI how they want it customized? In the future, every enterprise could have their own custom ERP, CRM or HRIS that is continually updating itself as the company itself is changing.  

A product based on this premise would be highly disruptive to large incumbents, because now they can’t win by just copying you and adding another feature to their bloated software. Now they would have to completely change their whole conceptual approach to building software.

Maybe the AI will get so good at this that it can think up new types of enterprise software that don’t even exist yet. Building this AI would be an interesting technical challenge and if you’re excited about building AI that can code, enterprise software is the most profitable software to build.
